Can play a variety of tones using the piano keyboard.

== Description ==

Piano Block is a plugin that allow you to play a variety of tones using the piano keyboard.
This plugin does not add any useful features to WordPress, nor does it add any useful blocks to help you write posts.
Let's insert this block and enjoy the music if you are stuck in writing an article or just want a little distraction.

- 15 instruments
- Realistic sound based on sound sources sampled from actual instruments
- Variable volume, switchable octave pitch and sustain pedal status
- Synthesizer with 18 oscillators and customizable envelope

Note: The keys are optimized for the QWERTY keyboard and may not map correctly on other keyboards.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `piano-block` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How will this block be displayed on the frontend ? =

By default, nothing is output to the front end. If you turn on "Display on the front end" in the sidebar settings, the piano will also appear on the front end and the visitors to yout site can play. However, multiple pianos cannot be displayed on the same page.

= Is it possible to record the sound of my play ? =

Recording is not supported in the current version due to technical or licensing issues.
I may add it in a future update if those issues can be resolved.
